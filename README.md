INSTRUCTIONS
Any set of data can be graphed many ways and varying views allow us to see different things. Let’s look at a specific instance of numerous graphs plotting the same data.


### Machine Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning

* [k-means Cluster Analysis Salary Potential](https://github.com/blumoestit/R_Projects/tree/master/2.%20k-means%20Cluster%20Analysis%20Salary%20Potential) - a comparison of the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, application a k-means clustering analysis, and visualization the results.

* [Cluster Analysis Bundestagswahl Berlin](https://github.com/blumoestit/R_Projects/tree/master/3.%20Cluster%20Analysis%20Bundestagswahl%20Berlin) - defines groups of polling stations based on the predominance of political preferences of inhabitants in Berlin-Pankow district, from federal election results in 2017.
